***M12_v1_description) Bioinformaticianâ€™s goals***
***M12_v1_1) What are three main services that Bioinformaticians provide?***


The three main services bioinformatics can provide is Data Integration, Data 
Analysis, and Data Visualization.


***M12_v2_description) Common plots part 1***
***M12_v2_1) What plot can be helpful in determining if your normalization process was successful? Explain what it shows***


The best plot for determining normalization process are Box Plots. They're great
at comparing data values and the change in distribution after normalization.


***M12_v3_description) Common plots part 2***
***M12_v3_1) What is the purpose of a Venn Diagram and what is its limitation?***


A Venn Diagram is great for comparing elements in a list, like overlapping 
differentially expressed genes. However, it's limited when you want to compare 
more than three lists as the graphs become more complex.


***M12_v4_description) Genomic Data Visualization part 1***
***M12_v4_1) How can we use Genome browsers to visualize RNA-seq data?***


The Genome browser can visualize RNA-seq data by showing the nucleotides in the 
given RNA sequence and revealing the gaps, exons, and splice sites. It also
provides a dendrogram for phlogenomics, and can show you where the reads align 
against the reference genome. 


***M12_v4_2) How do you create a dot plot?***


Is made with the genomic viewer data.


***M12_v5_description) Genomic Data Visualization part 2***
***M12_v5_1) How is the height in a Sequence Logo graph calculated?***


You calculate the entropy measure against the variability of each position. 


***M12_v5_2) How can you avoid making mistakes in interpreting dendrograms?***


You need to know how your graph is rooted, and make assupmtions about the distance 
using the x axis.


***M12_v6_description) Genomic Data Visualization part 3***
***M12_v6_1) What can you conclude by clustering samples instead of genes?***


Clustering by samples can tell you how closely related the samples are to one another.
CLustering by genes may show you expression patterns, but it won't differentiate the samples.


***M12_v6_2) Why do we calculate the -log10() of the p-value when creating a volcano plot?***


We calculate the -log10() of the pvalue so on the graph we see things that are more 
significant at the top of the graph and can clearly see genes with a significant 
fold change and pvalue. 


***M12_v6_3) How can we use heatmaps to interpret our data?***


Heatmaps help us understand paterns in our data by using clustering to seperate 
the data. Heatmaps show more dimensions in patterns than a dendrogram would. 


***M12_v7_description) Principal Component Analysis***
***M12_v7_1) What is the relationship between principal components and the variation in the data?***


Principal components reduce dimiensionality so we can better see the amount of 
variation and the range of variation there is in the data. 


***M12_v8_description) Gene Networks***
***M12_v8_1) Give three examples of edges in a gene network and the nodes that connect them.***


One edge type is a metabolic reaction with nodes being the metabolite and the metabolic 
gene. Another edge type is Protein Protein interaction with the nodes being two 
proteins, and a third edge is microRNA/RNA relations  where the nodes are miRNA 
and Target RNA.


***M12_v8_2) What kind of edges can you draw using RNA-seq experimental data?***


With RNA-seq experimental data, we can draw edges of regulatory interactions or 
biological processes.
